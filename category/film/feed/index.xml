								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BFFContentPage.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1283" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BFFContentPage.jpg" alt="BFFContentPage" width="640" height="350" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BFFContentPage.jpg 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BFFContentPage-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;As an historically disadvantaged filmmaker who has struggled to produce her films for the past 18 years, it is clear to me that black filmmakers need economic support to be able to consistently produce films that contribute to a more honest and more representative national story. Through informal discussions I am aware that there are many more black filmmakers who know the same.</p>
<p>The South African film sector perpetuates the current status quo through established structures, ways of operating and systemic racism that continues to support white filmmakers over their historically disadvantaged counterparts. As much as government may be committed to economic redress and to creating opportunities for black filmmakers, its attempts are encumbered by structural racism and the economic reality bequeathed to South Africa by apartheid.</p>
<p>Black filmmakers in the Western Cape in particular are frustrated that their needs are not being understood, addressed and acknowledged. It is clear that government funding through the NFVF is also limited and other than the NFVF and the DTI, where do filmmakers go to fund their films?</p>
<p>This situation has remained unchanged in the Western Cape and it is a problem that has continued to bother me. I realize that we need funding beyond government for black and historically disadvantaged filmmakers in the Western Cape in particular and in South Africa in general. Because of this, I agreed to develop, co-ordinate and moderate this panel discussion at the Encounters South African International Documentary Festival this year.&#8221;</p>

<p>The intensity of table tennis players, slammed me like one of the balls Pedro Meyer was so fond of breaking in front of his opponents. Watching this local table tennis legend talk about his love of the sport infected me with a twitching of hands &#8211; looking for a bat.</p>
<p>A master tactician, a superb player and Western Province Captain, deserves the acknowledgement this documentary gives him. This is a rare glimpse into the world of professional players, and their backyard beginnings, from Lansdowne to London, Bishop Lavis to Sweden. The dreams and the means to achieve them, this is what he coached, along with commitment and joy.</p>
<p>Athlete, father and husband but first always Mr Table Tennis.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I started working doing the research for the three pilot episodes of <em>Engender</em>, I immediately felt the energy of people coming together to tackle gender inequality in South African society. There was an understanding that the <em>Engender</em> series was being created to give a platform or a voice to people who could take us on a journey to show that our world is engendered, to help us understand how gender socialisation impacts on people and society, and to explore feminism as a  movement to organise and act against gender equality.</p>
<p>My role as researcher was to develop the content of each episode, that is to determine the focus of  each episode, to find guest panelists who have the knowledge, experience  and liveliness to discuss the topics in a way that could appeal to all types of viewers. This meant reading academic and popular material, interviewing individuals and the staff of organisations working on gender issues and feminism. It also meant finding video material and developing our own material that could show our viewers that gender inequality is not only a local, but a global challenge and how feminism was getting people to organise and take action.</p>
<p>Another exciting part of being on the team producing <em>Engender</em>, was going out onto the street to record interviews with different people about gender inequality and feminism. Speaking to people around the topics – <em>What is Feminism?</em>, <em>Representations of Gender in Media</em>, and <em>Intersectionality</em> – brought me to the realisation that many people had (and have) experiences of gender inequality and an awareness of feminism. Now, given an opportunity, they were willing to share and discuss. Explaining to people that <em>Engender</em> is a feminist programme was like lighting a fire. Many heated discussions followed starting with, “I thought men and women were equal, why do we still need feminism?” or “Yes we need feminism as gender inequality is so bad. We need more programmes like this.”</p>
<div id="attachment_1229" style="width: 625px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ECEngender01.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1229" class="wp-image-1229 size-full" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ECEngender01.jpg" alt="Erna in Open Studio" width="615" height="488" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ECEngender01.jpg 615w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ECEngender01-300x238.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1229" class="wp-caption-text">Erna during a TV interview about Engender</p></div>
<p>Doing the research and being part of the team producing the programme meant that I learnt a lot about the history and development of feminism through time and what it means today. To me it means the recognition of the humanity and equal gender rights of every man and woman, of any age and ability, race, class, culture and ethnicity. I got a chance to be educated about gender and sexual minorities: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer and asexual (LGBTIQA) people, and the terms and language that we should use to communicate and collaborate to make the spaces we move in safer and inclusive. This presented a challenge – using the wrong terms and language could easily offend or make someone feel excluded and we worked hard to make the production an inclusive, fair and collective space where every person involved could feel free and safe to voice their experience and opinions.</p>
<p>What I liked most about working on <em>Engender</em> was the enthusiasm and positive energy from all involved towards creating a programme where black women and allies controlled, managed and created the content. I did not feel alone, I felt like there was a collective of people collaborating at all times towards the same aim. TV is a powerful medium of communication, information and education that can reinforce gender inequality in society, but it can also be the means of raising awareness and empowering people to act for gender equality.</p>
<p>Each episode of <em>Engender</em> is an hour long, it is a talk show with guests and a studio audience, interesting and entertaining video clips showing global and local voices on each topic. With the pilot series we have just begun the journey of <em>Engender</em> – exploring gender inequality and feminist action to create a more just and equal world for all.</p>
<p>The fire has been lit! And I know we all look forward to hearing from everyone involved and the viewers about the impact of the programme, as much as we look forward to producing more programmes!</p>

				<description><![CDATA[ I didn’t know much about feminism before working on the production; all that I knew was that a feminist is someone who believes in equal rights for men and women.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Working on <em>Engender</em> has been an educational experience. I didn’t know much about feminism before working on the production; all that I knew was that a feminist is someone who believes in equal rights for men and women.</p>
<p>Throughout the pre-production process of <em>Engender</em> my knowledge about feminism broadened. Reading articles, blog posts, listening to conversations and attending workshops with the funder of the talk show added to my knowledge on feminism. Through conversations the team also shared their experiences on the different forms of discrimination and sexism they faced on a daily basis and discussed ways to raise awareness about this and hopefully change it.</p>
<p>Working on <em>Engender</em> has made me more observant about everyday sexism and discrimination, which I didn’t pick up on before. I didn’t pick up on it before because it’s always been there, even though it did make me feel uncomfortable. For example, if you go walking on the street you know that men will catcall you. It’s awful, but it’s the norm, so it’s expected, which it shouldn’t be. Other examples are that most, if not all, clothing shops only have pink clothes for girls and blue clothes for boys, and adverts on TV only show women in traditional domestic roles. It would be great to see a TV ad where the male in the household is busy in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The pilot of <em>Engender</em> consisted of three shows, which each explored a different topic. They were: What is Feminism, Media and Representation, and Intersectionality. Intersectionality is a word used to explain the way your gender, age, culture, class, sexual preference, ability, upbringing, race and surroundings influence your choices and opportunities. They also influence how society views you and treats you, which results in an experience of either privilege or oppression for the individual.</p>
<p>My role on the production was co-ordinator, which is basically making sure everyone and everything is where it needs to be, when it needs to be there. What I enjoyed the most, however, was going out on the streets to record the vox pops (asking the general public questions on the street). It’s always interesting to hear people’s opinions … if you manage to convince them to speak on camera.</p>
<div id="attachment_1222" style="width: 625px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MJEngender01.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1222" class="wp-image-1222 size-full" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MJEngender01.jpg" alt="Megan in studio" width="615" height="488" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MJEngender01.jpg 615w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MJEngender01-300x238.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1222" class="wp-caption-text">Megan checks up on the studio activities during set-up</p></div>
<p>Working on <em>Engender</em> has also increased my knowledge about transgender people and a-gender people (people who don’t identify with being either man or woman). I also didn’t know much about transgender people and only learnt more about the topic when Caitlyn Jenner was highly covered in mainstream media. I find her reality show extremely informative as she speaks about the different issues she faces daily. One episode was about how she wanted to undergo surgery to make her voice more feminine because it still made her feel like a man. <em>Engender</em> has made me interested in learning more about transgender and a-gender people. In the future I hope we get to cover both as an <em>Engender</em> episode topic.</p>
<p>Going forward, I really hope we get feedback from viewers after the shows air. I’m curious to find out people’s reactions and whether it’s made them more observant about the world around them like it has made me.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Transcribing was my first main task. It’s time consuming, but I enjoy it because I like to hear what people have to say.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it came to deciding what I wanted to be when I grew up, I always questioned whether it should be just one thing. I mean it’s quite a commitment to pick one career for the rest of your life. That’s why I’m happy I chose to work in TV because there are always many different tasks to complete.</p>
<p>The chance to make what people see on TV has always been a dream and that’s why I studied Journalism and Media Studies. I find telling stories a magical thing and I definitely wanted to tell other people’s stories.</p>
<p>I was able to add Journalist to my CV when I worked on a news programme that focused on positive stories in the community, told through the voices of the characters. I liked being able to do this because I didn’t see myself as a journalist reporting on all the negative events in the world.</p>
<p>On the documentary film, <em>Mr Table Tennis</em>, I get to continue to explore the storytelling process as the production assistant. I am thrilled that I am making what I enjoy watching.</p>
<div id="attachment_1183" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MyFirstFilm.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1183" class="size-full wp-image-1183" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MyFirstFilm.jpg" alt="Megan transcribes" width="600" height="472" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MyFirstFilm.jpg 600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MyFirstFilm-300x236.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1183" class="wp-caption-text">Megan transcribes</p></div>
<p>Transcribing was my first main task. It’s time consuming, but I enjoy it because I like to hear what people have to say. Luckily, on <em>Mr Table Tennis</em>, people had interesting things to say. The best feeling was getting to know characters through their interviews. They made me laugh, sad, angry, excited, proud, happy and, overall, inspired. It’s strange that even though I haven’t met them, I feel connected to each person whose interview I transcribed.</p>
<p>Completing this documentary continues to be a great adventure because I’m working with great people. Reading some of the paper edit made the story come together and I started to picture the documentary in my head. I CAN’T WAIT to see the final product and to see my name in the credits.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am enjoying this process of cobbling together our first grown-up documentary film. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“first” and “grown-up” because I have worked on and produced a few short documentary films on my own. Some of them only a close circle of friends may have seen. I could call them exclusive, but only as a joke. I wonder how much I could sell these exclusive films for …</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The enjoyment comes partly from the fact that the team is really invested in the people and the story. Eileen, our editor, e.g. is upset at how the storyline has developed. Two nights in a row she brought it up and expressed her incredulity and displeasure. I am pleased that she cares enough to be displeased. While I have spent three years working on the story, the researcher, Erna, has spent two months on the story, and the transcribers, Megan and Prudence, have spent less time on the project, but have certainly been most intimate with the characters through the transcription process, and at the time of writing this Eileen had only spent one week getting to know the characters and the story to date. I hope that Eileen’s response to the story is an indication of how viewers may feel when they watch the film. Fingers crossed. Eyes crossed. Legs crossed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a few anecdotes about people’s emotional connection to the story, but the one that has made me chuckle recently (because I received his final invoice) is the one about our sound person, Craig. Each of his invoices is for the project titled, Mr Table Tennis, the Meyer of table tennis, not simply for Mr Table Tennis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The team is attached to the people in the story and I hope that we do the people and the story justice. And I hope that I do the team justice. I hope that the film reflects the effort and commitment of everyone who worked on the film (both before the film was commissioned and after) and of those who have supported me at home. I hope, I hope, I hope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hope is not enough, of course. I need to put in the hard work to realise the hope. Only time will tell if I did enough. If I haven’t done enough, hopefully (that word again), I would have learnt what more needs to be done for next time. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The South African Table Tennis Open Championships took place in Bloemfontein from 7 &#8211; 12 July this year.</p>
<p>Thulani and I headed north into the unexpectedly bitter inland temperatures to follow Shane Overmeyer&#8217;s progress through the tournament. Shane is from Cape Town and has been the SA Open champion seven times. <a title="Excerpt from 2014 SA Open" href="./../../../2014-sa-table-tennis-open/%20/index.html">His goal this year was to hold the title for the eighth time</a>.</p>
<p>The image of the keys to my bedroom at the B&amp;B on the frozen pond, should send chills down the spine of any warm blooded Capetonian &#8211; Capetonians balk at temperatures of 10 degrees Celsius. Thulani and I were outdoors at 22h00 in 1 degree Celsius, waiting waiting waiting for our closing shot. Before I forget, we were up at 06h00 one morning when the temperature registered -7 degrees Celsius to capture the sun rising over Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>But then we also got the chance to see zebras and giraffes strolling past us &#8230; in the middle of Bloemfontein. We went to Naval Hill to capture the sunrise, drove through the booms free of charge &#8211; all the security guard wanted to know, was whether we were coming to pray.</p>

<p><em>Mr Table Tennis</em> is the inter-generational story of Pedro and Cody Meyer. Their big dreams unfold against an ambiguous socio-economic climate that determines the choices they make in life and in table tennis.</p>
<p>Pedro Meyer was a brilliant table tennis player and a showman. Living under apartheid meant he was unable to test his game on the international stage. Today he has placed his dreams of world domination in his grandson, Cody.</p>
<p>Growing up in the New South Africa, Cody has been able to travel and compete internationally and he knows his family would like him to continue where his grandfather left off.</p>
<p>Cody is torn between pursuing his new passion, DJing, and table tennis, which is in his blood.</p>

<h3>COMMENTS</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Loved it! Beautifully nuanced, and soulful. Great generational juxtaposition. Who woulda thought table tennis played such a pivotal role in the struggle as the first sporting code to force sanctions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Talk about untold stories!   </span>DINGI NTULI, PRODUCER, MASALA FILMWORKS</p>

<p><em>African Queen</em> was the last film I made in the series and seems to always be the first film that is selected for festivals and screenings. I enjoyed making the film and working with the people in the story. Lorraine, Ellen and everyone else in the film were all extremely accommodating and patient with the process and I think this is reflected in a certain lightness I feel about the film.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t put my finger on it yet, but this film feels like poetry. Maybe this comes from the wind, maybe it comes from the shadows, maybe it comes from the natural resources and ingenuity that go into the products &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t say. It&#8217;s just a feeling.</p>
