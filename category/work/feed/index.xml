								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Accidental Films and TV was thrilled when the team at SAE Institute in Woodstock signed us up to run <strong>Game Plan</strong> for their third year students in August.</p>
<p>The <strong>Film and Business Game Plan </strong>introduces students to the business model canvas as a tool that will help them to identify and design (and re-design) the unique business model for their projects. At the end of the course they are able to apply the tool to any project in the future and use business terminology with confidence. <strong>Game Plan</strong> stands participants in good stead to approach creative projects with a solid understanding of how the creative interacts with and is influenced by the business and vice versa.</p>

<p>After five years of writing proposals, knocking on doors and all round championing of the <a href="https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas">Business Model Canvas</a> tool, <a href="http://www.capetown.sae.edu/">SAE</a> took the bait. We were delighted that someone had realized how the canvas can assist their students at school and going forward with their careers as filmmakers. Not only that, their curriculum was flexible enough to accommodate three x three hour workshops that took students through the ins-and-outs of the canvas.</p>
<p>Here are some comments from the pioneering third year Game Plan class:</p>
<blockquote><p>It simplified and made the terminology easier to understand.</p>
<p>I am going to approach future projects with more confidence and an open mind.</p>
<p>The workshop has allowed me to improve my business model and future business practice in ways I did not know were necessary.</p>
<p>It will make me more organized and prepared.</p>
<p>It helped me to know my customers and their demands better.</p>
<p>It helped me to collect more information about my project.</p></blockquote>

<p>Accidental Films and TV co-ordinated and moderated the second edition of the Black Filmmakers Forum at the 19th Encounters Documentary Festival in 2017. You may listen to the discussion by pressing the play button above.</p>
<p>In conversation with filmmakers, Sylvia Vollenhoven, Weaam Williams, and Vuyokazi Matu, who share their experiences, this edition of the Black Filmmakers Forum explores the role of broadcasters and how their support or lack thereof affects us on a local and international level.</p>
<p>The discussion was recorded on a phone and we have done our best to get the audio levels constant, but because of distance from speakers, it does fluctuate. Using headphones will make it easier to hear the softer speakers.</p>
<p>You will hear the sound of a guitar string being plucked each time there is an edit in the conversation. The edits happen when the recording was stopped (by the phone&#8217;s timer), or when there was an extended pause in the discussion. No content has otherwise been edited from the conversation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1360 size-full" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HishamAshour.jpg" width="640" height="350" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HishamAshour.jpg 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HishamAshour-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Around mid-February 2017 we were contacted by Hisham Ashour who is studying Communication at Northwestern University in Qatar. Hisham and his group were interested to learn more about <em>Engender</em>, especially with regards to the intersection of race and feminism in South African media.</span></p>
<p>He is interested in the representation of feminism on TV because it is a topic which has recently become more and more relevant globally as media has made access to information around equality much easier than before. Another reason for his interest in <em>Engender</em> was that he was looking at media which was neither mainstream American nor mainstream European. (<em>Engender</em> was broadcast on the community TV platforms Cape Town TV and 1KZN TV in South Africa) The broad goal of his research was to complete a textual analysis along with the research to see how the themes of race and gender were conveyed. This will be part of his group&#8217;s presentation for their class called Understanding Media Contexts.</p>
<p>Hisham says they were interested in feminism because they believe it is often misunderstood. They also aimed to compare and contrast the different issues feminists face abroad and their media approaches.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BFFContentPage.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1283" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BFFContentPage.jpg" alt="BFFContentPage" width="640" height="350" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BFFContentPage.jpg 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/07/BFFContentPage-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;As an historically disadvantaged filmmaker who has struggled to produce her films for the past 18 years, it is clear to me that black filmmakers need economic support to be able to consistently produce films that contribute to a more honest and more representative national story. Through informal discussions I am aware that there are many more black filmmakers who know the same.</p>
<p>The South African film sector perpetuates the current status quo through established structures, ways of operating and systemic racism that continues to support white filmmakers over their historically disadvantaged counterparts. As much as government may be committed to economic redress and to creating opportunities for black filmmakers, its attempts are encumbered by structural racism and the economic reality bequeathed to South Africa by apartheid.</p>
<p>Black filmmakers in the Western Cape in particular are frustrated that their needs are not being understood, addressed and acknowledged. It is clear that government funding through the NFVF is also limited and other than the NFVF and the DTI, where do filmmakers go to fund their films?</p>
<p>This situation has remained unchanged in the Western Cape and it is a problem that has continued to bother me. I realize that we need funding beyond government for black and historically disadvantaged filmmakers in the Western Cape in particular and in South Africa in general. Because of this, I agreed to develop, co-ordinate and moderate this panel discussion at the Encounters South African International Documentary Festival this year.&#8221;</p>

<p>The intensity of table tennis players, slammed me like one of the balls Pedro Meyer was so fond of breaking in front of his opponents. Watching this local table tennis legend talk about his love of the sport infected me with a twitching of hands &#8211; looking for a bat.</p>
<p>A master tactician, a superb player and Western Province Captain, deserves the acknowledgement this documentary gives him. This is a rare glimpse into the world of professional players, and their backyard beginnings, from Lansdowne to London, Bishop Lavis to Sweden. The dreams and the means to achieve them, this is what he coached, along with commitment and joy.</p>
<p>Athlete, father and husband but first always Mr Table Tennis.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I started working doing the research for the three pilot episodes of <em>Engender</em>, I immediately felt the energy of people coming together to tackle gender inequality in South African society. There was an understanding that the <em>Engender</em> series was being created to give a platform or a voice to people who could take us on a journey to show that our world is engendered, to help us understand how gender socialisation impacts on people and society, and to explore feminism as a  movement to organise and act against gender equality.</p>
<p>My role as researcher was to develop the content of each episode, that is to determine the focus of  each episode, to find guest panelists who have the knowledge, experience  and liveliness to discuss the topics in a way that could appeal to all types of viewers. This meant reading academic and popular material, interviewing individuals and the staff of organisations working on gender issues and feminism. It also meant finding video material and developing our own material that could show our viewers that gender inequality is not only a local, but a global challenge and how feminism was getting people to organise and take action.</p>
<p>Another exciting part of being on the team producing <em>Engender</em>, was going out onto the street to record interviews with different people about gender inequality and feminism. Speaking to people around the topics – <em>What is Feminism?</em>, <em>Representations of Gender in Media</em>, and <em>Intersectionality</em> – brought me to the realisation that many people had (and have) experiences of gender inequality and an awareness of feminism. Now, given an opportunity, they were willing to share and discuss. Explaining to people that <em>Engender</em> is a feminist programme was like lighting a fire. Many heated discussions followed starting with, “I thought men and women were equal, why do we still need feminism?” or “Yes we need feminism as gender inequality is so bad. We need more programmes like this.”</p>
<div id="attachment_1229" style="width: 625px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ECEngender01.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1229" class="wp-image-1229 size-full" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ECEngender01.jpg" alt="Erna in Open Studio" width="615" height="488" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ECEngender01.jpg 615w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ECEngender01-300x238.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1229" class="wp-caption-text">Erna during a TV interview about Engender</p></div>
<p>Doing the research and being part of the team producing the programme meant that I learnt a lot about the history and development of feminism through time and what it means today. To me it means the recognition of the humanity and equal gender rights of every man and woman, of any age and ability, race, class, culture and ethnicity. I got a chance to be educated about gender and sexual minorities: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer and asexual (LGBTIQA) people, and the terms and language that we should use to communicate and collaborate to make the spaces we move in safer and inclusive. This presented a challenge – using the wrong terms and language could easily offend or make someone feel excluded and we worked hard to make the production an inclusive, fair and collective space where every person involved could feel free and safe to voice their experience and opinions.</p>
<p>What I liked most about working on <em>Engender</em> was the enthusiasm and positive energy from all involved towards creating a programme where black women and allies controlled, managed and created the content. I did not feel alone, I felt like there was a collective of people collaborating at all times towards the same aim. TV is a powerful medium of communication, information and education that can reinforce gender inequality in society, but it can also be the means of raising awareness and empowering people to act for gender equality.</p>
<p>Each episode of <em>Engender</em> is an hour long, it is a talk show with guests and a studio audience, interesting and entertaining video clips showing global and local voices on each topic. With the pilot series we have just begun the journey of <em>Engender</em> – exploring gender inequality and feminist action to create a more just and equal world for all.</p>
<p>The fire has been lit! And I know we all look forward to hearing from everyone involved and the viewers about the impact of the programme, as much as we look forward to producing more programmes!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Working on <em>Engender</em> has been an educational experience. I didn’t know much about feminism before working on the production; all that I knew was that a feminist is someone who believes in equal rights for men and women.</p>
<p>Throughout the pre-production process of <em>Engender</em> my knowledge about feminism broadened. Reading articles, blog posts, listening to conversations and attending workshops with the funder of the talk show added to my knowledge on feminism. Through conversations the team also shared their experiences on the different forms of discrimination and sexism they faced on a daily basis and discussed ways to raise awareness about this and hopefully change it.</p>
<p>Working on <em>Engender</em> has made me more observant about everyday sexism and discrimination, which I didn’t pick up on before. I didn’t pick up on it before because it’s always been there, even though it did make me feel uncomfortable. For example, if you go walking on the street you know that men will catcall you. It’s awful, but it’s the norm, so it’s expected, which it shouldn’t be. Other examples are that most, if not all, clothing shops only have pink clothes for girls and blue clothes for boys, and adverts on TV only show women in traditional domestic roles. It would be great to see a TV ad where the male in the household is busy in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The pilot of <em>Engender</em> consisted of three shows, which each explored a different topic. They were: What is Feminism, Media and Representation, and Intersectionality. Intersectionality is a word used to explain the way your gender, age, culture, class, sexual preference, ability, upbringing, race and surroundings influence your choices and opportunities. They also influence how society views you and treats you, which results in an experience of either privilege or oppression for the individual.</p>
<p>My role on the production was co-ordinator, which is basically making sure everyone and everything is where it needs to be, when it needs to be there. What I enjoyed the most, however, was going out on the streets to record the vox pops (asking the general public questions on the street). It’s always interesting to hear people’s opinions … if you manage to convince them to speak on camera.</p>

<p>Working on <em>Engender</em> has also increased my knowledge about transgender people and a-gender people (people who don’t identify with being either man or woman). I also didn’t know much about transgender people and only learnt more about the topic when Caitlyn Jenner was highly covered in mainstream media. I find her reality show extremely informative as she speaks about the different issues she faces daily. One episode was about how she wanted to undergo surgery to make her voice more feminine because it still made her feel like a man. <em>Engender</em> has made me interested in learning more about transgender and a-gender people. In the future I hope we get to cover both as an <em>Engender</em> episode topic.</p>
<p>Going forward, I really hope we get feedback from viewers after the shows air. I’m curious to find out people’s reactions and whether it’s made them more observant about the world around them like it has made me.</p>
