								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Experimenting with After Effects this weekend, I began with trying to animate the logo I designed for myself. Not entirely happy with the result and rather than chip away at it tirelessly without really knowing what I wanted to do, I decided to work on something more distant.</p>
<p>Unbeknown to him, I chose <a title="Grondwerk's twitter account" href="http://twitter.com/Grondwerk" target="_blank">Grondwerk</a>&#8216;s domain name, thinking that if I wasn&#8217;t happy with it, he would never have to see it, and if I was happy with it, he didn&#8217;t have to be. I worked away on Saturday afternoon with the help of an <a title="After Effects tutorial episodes" href="http://tv.adobe.com/show/adobe-beginner-classes-with-dennis-radeke" target="_blank">After Effects video tutorial</a> that makes it all so clear.</p>
<p>I designed a simple logo with a classic look and found myself hoping that Grondwerk would like it. When I realised that I wanted him to like it, I started to worry that if he didn&#8217;t like it, I would be gutted and not continue my experiments. Then I remembered that I am not easily discouraged when I am having fun and believe in what I am doing, and what I was having fun doing and believing in was experimenting.</p>
<p>Turn on your volume to experience the result:<br />

<p>The music sampled is &#8220;It&#8217;s good to be here&#8221; from the Digable Planets&#8217; 1993Â  debut album &#8220;Reachin&#8217; (A new Refutation of Time and Space)&#8221;.</p>
